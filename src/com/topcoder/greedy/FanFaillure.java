	Example from the problem statement.

	22
	Returns: { 0,  0 }
	No fans can fail in this system.

	{676, 11, 223, 413, 823, 122, 547, 187, 28}
	1000
	Returns: { 7,  2 }
	If you eliminate fans with 676, 11, 413, 122, 547, 187, and 28, you are left with 223 + 823 = 1046 
	units of cooling, which is sufficient, yielding an MFS size of 7. If you eliminate 676, 823, and 547, 
	you are left with only 984 units of cooling. All combinations of 2 or less fans breaking leaves sufficient 
	cooling, so the MFC is 2.
